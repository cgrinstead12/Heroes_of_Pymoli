Our assignment was to do an analysis of a video game called Pylomi. We were given a csv file of purchases by users along with their age and gender. The vast majority of the 780 purchases, which came from the 576 unique users, were from male users (113%). Also of note, nearly 20% of the purchases came from female users.
